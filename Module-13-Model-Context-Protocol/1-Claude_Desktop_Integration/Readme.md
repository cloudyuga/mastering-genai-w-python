# **How to integrate MCP server with Claude Desktop?** 
### Create a new directory for our project
uv init <project_dir>
cd <project_dir>

### Create virtual environment and activate it
uv venv
-> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
.venv\Scripts\activate

.venv\Scripts\Activate

### Install dependencies
uv add mcp[cli] httpx
pip install modelcontextprotocol

### Create our server file
new-item weather.py (you will find this file in /MCP_Servers folder)

What’s happening under the hood? When you ask a question:

- The client sends your question to Claude

- Claude analyzes the available tools and decides which one(s) to use

- The client executes the chosen tool(s) through the MCP server

- The results are sent back to Claude

- Claude formulates a natural language response

- The response is displayed to you!
